###Overview
=================================
The goal of this project is to practice and play around on getting real raw data and transforms it into a desired tidy data set.

This repo contains 3 files:
* run_analysis.R
* CodeBook.md
* README.md

=================================
###run_analysis.R

This file contains the R script needed to download the raw data needed to be transformed and transform it to tidy data. For further information on how the script works, read the 'on-the-script' documentation.

###CodeBook.md
This file contains the code book of the data used and resulted after running run_analysis.R.
